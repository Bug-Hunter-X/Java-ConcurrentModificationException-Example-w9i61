This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates the ConcurrentModificationException and its solution. The ConcurrentModificationException is a common error in Java when modifying a collection while iterating over it using an iterator that doesn't support concurrent modification. The solution demonstrates a safe way to modify the list during iteration.
